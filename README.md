## üìù Recommendations (Hypothetical)
1.  **Optimize Driver Allocation**: Based on peak booking times and popular vehicle types, optimize driver allocation to reduce 'No Driver Found' instances and improve service speed.
2.  **Address Cancellation Root Causes**: Investigate and implement solutions for the most common customer and driver cancellation reasons to increase booking completion rates.
3.  **Enhance Vehicle Type Performance**: Analyze the performance of different vehicle types and implement strategies to improve the efficiency or profitability of underperforming types.
4.  **Improve Customer and Driver Satisfaction**: Use insights from ratings and cancellation reasons to implement targeted programs for improving the experience of both customers and drivers.
